Installation
************

This document tells you how to install edrn.sync.


Quick Instructions
==================

As a user with administrative privileges, run::

    easy_install edrn.sync

That's it.


Full Instructions
=================

edrn.sync requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend version 2.4
or later.  As of this writing, 2.6 is the latest stable version.  If Python is
not yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and source
distributions from the Python website.

To test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::

    python -V
    
You should see output similar to::

    Python 2.6
    
indicating the version of Python installed.  edrn.sync also requires `Agile
OODT`_.  OODT_ is Object Oriented Data Technology, a framework for metadata
and data grids.  Agile OODT is a Python version of OODT that supports higher
performance and easier integration than the Java_ version.

By far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install edrn.sync is
to use EasyInstall_.  If your Python installation has EasyInstall available to
it, then this one command is all you need to run in order to download, build,
install, and generate command-line tools all in one go for all users on your
system::

    easy_install edrn.sync
    
Be sure to run that command as an administrative user.  For example, on Mac OS
X and other Unix systems, you might need to run::

    sudo easy_install edrn.sync

That will also download and install all dependencies, including Agile OODT.


Executables
-----------

The command ``dmccsync`` will be generated and placed with your
standard installation directory for Python commands.  Usually, this is the
same location as the ``python`` executable itself.  For example, on Mac OS X
10.5, the directory is::

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin

You may want to add that directory to your shell's PATH variable, as well as
forcing your shell to re-scan the PATH variable for new executables.


Installing EasyInstall
----------------------

If you happen to be on a system where your Python installation lacks easy
install, fret not.  Upgrading your system to gain EasyInstall's abilities is
quite simple.  Follow these instructions:

1.  Download http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
2.  As an administrative user, run the freshly-downloaded ez_setup.py file
    using your system's Python.

EasyInstall and its necessary libraries will be downloaded, built, and
installed for you, and the ``easy_install`` executable generated.  The
location of the ``easy_install`` executable is as described above.


Installing Without EasyInstall
------------------------------

If EasyInstall is not available on your system, you can still make a proper
installation of edrn.sync. Follow these instructions:

1.  Download the Agile OODT source distribution from
    http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/dist/agile-oodt/oodt-0.0.1.tar.gz.
    Substitute version numbers as appropriate.
2.  Download the edrn.sync source distribution from
    http://cancer.jpl.nasa.gov/dist/edrn-sync/edrn.sync-0.0.0.tar.gz.
    Substitute version numbers as appropriate.
3.  Unpack each archive.
4.  Change the current working directory to each newly-created subdirectory,
    ``oodt-0.0.1`` and ``edrn.sync-0.0.0``, again substituting version
    numbers as appropriate.
5.  As an administrative user, run:  ``python setup.py install`` in each
    subdirectory.
